    <p>Today was a big milestone.  You finally picked up The Odin Project again after such a long break.  This time however you're having fun!  Here are some key accomplishments so far.  You worked for about 90 min today and made some huge leaps in this journey.  Let's remember to stay positive and celebrate the wins.  I hope one day I look back on this vlog and code it up with some sweet CSS and Javascript.  For now, we're stoked on just it being in HTML.  Let's list out some wins for today!
